# Goal
It is an adaptation of the SGM algorithm to the Cybersecurity Investment Game (CIG) to find a delta-approximate Nash equilibrium.
The code is in julia (main functions + PWL approximation, located in the folder IPG-and-PWL/src) and python (SGM, located in the folder IPG).

## Instances
The format of the instances is unique, see for example IPG-and-PWL/instances/instance_2_2_1.txt.
their names "instance_i_j_k.txt" describe the number of players i and markets j. The k means that it is the k-th instance with parameters (i,j).
The cybersecurity cost function used is not described in the instance, but by the parameter "NL_term".

## Computing an approximated Nash equilibrium
The function SGM_PWL_absolute_direct_solver in file IPG-and-PWL/src/SGM_absolute_direct_solver.jl computes an approximated Nash equilibrium to an instance of the CIG with the time limit of 900 seconds (hard coded for now, accessible as an argument of function IterativeSG_NOT_DFS in file IPG/Compute_NE.py).
- filename_instance is a String, name of the instance inside the folder IPG-and-PWL/instances/
- fixed_costs (DEFAULT = true) is a boolean, indicating if opening a market costs a fixed cost, all experiences from the paper uses the value true
- refinement_method (DEFAULT = "sufficient_refinement") is a String, name of the method used to solve the instance:
	- "sufficient_refinement" => direct-approximation
	- "full_refinement" => 2-level approximation
	- "SGM_NL_model" => direct use of the SGM with the nonlinear solver SCIP, it handles only the cybersecurity cost function "S+inverse_square_root"
	- "SGM_gurobiNL_model" => direct use of the SGM with the nonlinear cybersecurity cost function approximated by quadratic constraints, it handles only the cybersecurity cost function "inverse_square_root"
	- "SGM_SOCP_model" => direct use of the SGM with the conic optimization solver MOSEK, it handles only the cybersecurity cost functions "inverse_square_root" and "log"
- rel_gap (DEFAULT = 0) is a float, giving the relative gap (after some modifications) used in the stopping criterion of the SGM. It should be 0 if one wants an (absolute) delta-approximate Nash equilibrium
- abs_gap (DEFAULT = 1e-4) is a float, giving the delta of the delta-approximate Nash equilibrium.
- err_pwlh (DEFAULT = Absolute(2.5e-5)) is an error type from LinA library. It is useful only for refinement_method == "full_refinement" (2-level approximation), giving the delta of the PWL delta-approximation of the cybersecurity cost function in the first iteration of SGM during method 2-level approximation.
- big_weights_on_NL_part (DEFAULT = false) is a boolean, used to increase some coefficients from the instance. It is set to false for all experiments in the paper
- NL_term (DEFAULT = "log") is a String, giving the cybersecurity cost function used in the instance. It can take values "log" (logarithmic function in the paper), "inverse_square_root" (inverse square root function in the paper) and "S+inverse_square_root" (nonconvex function in the paper)
- PWL_general_constraint (DEFAULT = true) is a boolean, describing if the PWL approximation is formulated by the MILP solver (true) or not (false). It can be used only if the PWL approximation is continuous, because Gurobi's addGenConstrPWL works only with continuous PWL functions
EXAMPLE:
SGM_PWL_absolute_direct_solver("instance_2_2_3.txt", refinement_method = "sufficient_refinement", NL_term = "S+inverse_square_root", PWL_general_constraint = false)
-> launches the computation of a delta-approximate Nash equilibrium with delta = 1e-4 (the default value of abs_gap) for the instance described in file IPG-and-PWL/instances/instance_2_2_3.txt with cybersecurity cost function "S+inverse_square_root", which is the nonconvex function in the paper.

## Benchmark
The function benchmark_SGM_absolute_direct_solver in file IPG-and-PWL/src/SGM_absolute_direct_solver.jl allows to launch many instances one after the other, created by taking all possibilities of parameters, while saving results in a file in a one-line fashion for each instance.
The parameters with same name as for function SGM_PWL_absolute_direct_solver plus an "s" at the end are lists for which the elements have the same meaning as for function SGM_PWL_absolute_direct_solver. Example: refinement_methods = ["SGM_SOCP_model","sufficient_refinement"] means all instance files will be solved with the two methods called by refinement_method = "SGM_SOCP_model" and "sufficient_refinement".
-max_iters (DEFAULT = [1]) is a list. It is deprecated and should be let to the default value
- filename_save (DEFAULT = "last_experiences.txt") is a String, indicating in which .txt file the results should be written
EXAMPLE:
benchmark_SGM_absolute_direct_solver(filename_instances = filename_instances, refinement_methods = ["SGM_NL_model","sufficient_refinement","full_refinement"], err_pwlhs = [Absolute(0.05)], NL_terms = ["S+inverse_square_root"], filename_save = "SCIP_exps/NL234.txt", PWL_general_constraint = false)
-> launches the experiments of "nonconvex234" in the paper and saves the results in "PWL-and-PWL/src/SCIP_exps/NL234.txt"

## One-line result of an instance
The different informations are separated by "::". It contains informations described in the two data structures "option_cs_instance" (parameters of the instance) and "output_cs_instance" (results of the instance) described in file "IPG-and-PWL/src/SGM_solver.jl". The number of iterations inside the SGM is NOT available in this file. It is accessible in separate .txt files for example called "log234_iteration.txt" for log234 instances.
This one-line result contains, in order of apparition:
- filename_instance
- err_pwlh
- fixed_costs
- refinement_method
- max_iter
- rel_gap
- abs_gap
- NL_term
- big_weights_on_NL_part
- solved, true if solved, false if time limit reached
- solution, value of the variables for all players at the approximated equilibrium, see solution below
- profits, profits of all players at the equilibrium
- cpu_time, total computation time (julia+python+python loading time)
- iter, deprecated
- delta_eq, deprecated
- length_pwls, number of pieces of PWL approximations during the last SGM solve
- variation_MNE, deprecated
- SGM_time, time spent inside the SGM
- julia_time, time spent inside the julia code (python code running time excluded)

# Analysis of one-line result files
To analyse the one-line result files, functions are available in file IPG-and-PWL/src/analyse_experiences.txt.
The figures in the paper are computed with function prepare_real_performance_profile_cybersecurity.
The fictive results with a better MINLP solver are computed with functions compute_best_response_computation_time, include_SCIP_fictive_times and prepare_real_performance_profile_cybersecurity.
An example of how they are computed is present in file IPG-and-PWL/src/compute_analysis.jl (warning: the naming in this file is particularly bad).
